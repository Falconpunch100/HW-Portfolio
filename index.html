      <p>Hey. I'm Jordan.</p>

      <p>I'm not a very sociable person. I suppose that's because I was pulled out of public school after Elementary School, since the staff at the schools were not kind about my autism/aspergers syndrome. Although, in a gaming community or with people I like, I'm actually pretty open.</p>

      <p>For most of my life, I've spent inside my house with my family, without any jobs or responsibilities, or goals for my future. As a result, I had a tendency to be very lazy at times before I learned to prioritize and handle my job. I also like to spend time with my family or by myself than work or do my homework. And even then, I would go at my own pace.</p>

      <p>I'm a gamer and an artist at heart, and I owe it all to my mom.</p>
